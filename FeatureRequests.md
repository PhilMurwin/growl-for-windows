# Growl-for-Windows #
## Introduction ##
Growl-for-Windows was built out of a desire to offer Growl on a Windows platform. While other options for _Growl-like_ functionality exist, Growl-for-Windows is intended to be a tool that follows the same path and feature set as Growl on OSX.

Below are the features associated with Growl-for-Windows.

# Feature Requests #
Please add any feature requests/bug fixes that you would like to see made to the project on the [Growl-for-Windows Issues page](http://code.google.com/p/growl-for-windows/issues/list). Just like any other new open source project, there are only a couple of people working on the project. Features will be implemented in order of perceived need of the community and the ease of implementing a feature. That said, we want to get as many features integrated as possible.

# Recently Implemented Features #
  * display stacking - stacks each of the notification displays on-top of other displays which have not 'expired' from view.
  * start app in system tray only

# Upcoming Features #
  * ability to dismiss all notifications at once
  * keyboard shortcuts to dismiss notifications
  * sound support
  * support application icons in App display list
  * support icons in displays better (dependent on upcoming Growl network protocol support)
